COVID-19 DEATH RATE ANALYSIS

1.Introduction
“Data has evolved over the years”. We generate a lot of data each second. To understand that and to get meaningful insights it is very important to process it.
Machine Learning is one such field which helps us in understanding the data better. It offers wide range of algorithms which in turn identifies the patterns and makes decisions with minimal human intervention. Many machine learning algorithms are used to solve real world problems today.
As stated in the No Free Lunch Theorem, some of the algorithms might give better results in some scenarios while others could perform better in some other scenarios. Thus, this project attempts to use different regression algorithms to find out the accuracy of each of them under certain conditions.
1.1 Aim and Purpose
The aim of the project is to create various models on the Covid-19 data available and conclude which one of these is better in terms of model accuracy, using the independent and the dependent variables from the datasets. In addition to the above, the selected datasets will be processed by removing unnecessary features.
2.Methods
2.1Datasetgchc
In Machine learning projects the most important part is to choose the data which fits our requirements for analysis. The results are purely based on the dataset we choose, the formatting done on them, their consistency, etc.,
The dataset we used in our project is from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
2.2 Properties of the dataset
There are a total of 67 different attributes in the dataset. Each of the attribute talks about covid-19 cases, for example the total cases per million, total deaths per million, population, etc.,
2.3 Exploring the dataset
To get better insights from the data it is important to understand the data which we are dealing with. For understanding the data better that is being used in this project we have performed few initial checks on each of the column present.
3. Data Analysis/Feature Engineering
To find out meaningful information and to support decision making based on the data provided, it is important to perform data analysis. Data Analysis is the process of removing null values, duplicates, and unwanted data from rows/columns from the datasets that we are using
